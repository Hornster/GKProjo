//In order to register a sprite, put it's name (without extension, like .png or .jpg, just make sure that the file in fact is an graphics file) here. The sprites are loaded from up to down
//if the sprite is inside a folder, add the name of the folder before the image and insert the character '/'
//between the names. Using this rule, you can direct the game through many folders. The path shall begin from the inside
//of the Resources folder.
//examples:
// ruyo/rSkill1
// io/io skill sprites/ioSkill3
//The '//' at the beggining of a line makes the line a comment, thus the game won't read the line.
